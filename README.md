# get_next_line Project README

## Overview

The **get_next_line** project is a fundamental part of my education at 42 school. This project focuses on writing a C function that reads a text file line by line, making it a versatile tool for processing text files in various applications.

## What I Learned

While working on the **get_next_line** project, I acquired essential knowledge and skills, including:

1. **File I/O:** I learned how to work with file descriptors in C, enabling me to efficiently read data from text files.

2. **Memory Management:** This project taught me the importance of managing memory effectively, especially when dealing with dynamic data that may vary in size.

3. **Data Structures:** I gained experience in using data structures to store and manage text data, making it accessible line by line.

4. **Input/Output Operations:** The project helped me master input and output operations, a crucial skill for various software development tasks.

## Functionality

The **get_next_line** function takes a file descriptor as an argument and retrieves the next line of text from the associated file. It allows for efficient and flexible text file processing.

## Usage

You can integrate the **get_next_line** function into your C programs to read and process text files line by line. Simply include the function in your code and pass the appropriate file descriptor.

```c
get_next_line([fd]);
```
